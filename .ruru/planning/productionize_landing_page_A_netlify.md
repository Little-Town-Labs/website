# Productionalization Plan: Landing Page (output_design_A) for Netlify Deployment

This document outlines the steps to prepare the selected landing page (`output_design_A/`) for production deployment on Netlify.

## 1. Code Refinement & Validation

*   **1.1. HTML Validation:**
    *   Goal: Ensure `output_design_A/index.html` is well-formed and valid.
    *   Action: Use a W3C validator or similar tool.
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `lead-frontend`
*   **1.2. CSS Validation & Linting:**
    *   Goal: Ensure `output_design_A/style.css` is valid and follows best practices.
    *   Action: Use a W3C CSS validator and a linter (e.g., Stylelint).
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `lead-frontend`
*   **1.3. Code Formatting:**
    *   Goal: Ensure consistent code style.
    *   Action: Use Prettier or similar formatter.
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `lead-frontend`
*   **1.4. Remove Unused Code/Comments:**
    *   Goal: Clean up files for production.
    *   Action: Manual review or automated tools.
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `lead-frontend`

## 2. Asset Management & Optimization

*   **2.1. Localize External Assets:**
    *   Goal: Host all images locally instead of hotlinking from Unsplash.
    *   Action: Download `photo-1451187580459-43490279c0fa` (hero) and `photo-1496715976403-7e36dc43f17b` (approach). Store them in an `assets/images/` subfolder within `output_design_A/`. Update CSS paths.
    *   Assigned: `lead-design` / `dev-core-web`
*   **2.2. Image Optimization:**
    *   Goal: Reduce image file sizes without significant quality loss.
    *   Action: Use tools like TinyPNG/JPG, ImageOptim, or Squoosh. Convert to modern formats like WebP if appropriate.
    *   Assigned: `lead-design` / `dev-core-web`
*   **2.3. Favicon:**
    *   Goal: Add a project favicon.
    *   Action: Create/obtain favicon files (e.g., `.ico`, `.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`, `manifest.json`) and link them in `index.html`.
    *   Assigned: `lead-design`

## 3. Performance Enhancements

*   **3.1. Minification:**
    *   Goal: Reduce file sizes of HTML, CSS.
    *   Action: Implement a build step or use online tools for minification. (Netlify can often do this automatically for assets).
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops` (if build step) / `dev-core-web`
*   **3.2. Browser Caching:**
    *   Goal: Improve load times for returning visitors.
    *   Action: Configure appropriate caching headers (Netlify often handles this well by default for static assets).
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops` (to verify Netlify settings)

## 4. SEO & Accessibility Basics

*   **4.1. Meta Tags:**
    *   Goal: Ensure `index.html` has an appropriate `<title>` and `<meta name="description" content="...">`.
    *   Action: Review and update as needed based on Little Town Labs' core messaging.
    *   Assigned: `util-writer` / `manager-product`
*   **4.2. Semantic HTML:**
    *   Goal: Verify use of semantic HTML5 elements for better structure and accessibility.
    *   Action: Review `index.html`.
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `util-accessibility`
*   **4.3. Alt Text for Images:**
    *   Goal: Ensure all `<img>` tags have descriptive `alt` attributes.
    *   Action: Review `index.html`.
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `util-accessibility`

## 5. Netlify Deployment Setup

*   **5.1. Git Repository:**
    *   Goal: Version control the `output_design_A` project.
    *   Action: Initialize a Git repository in the `output_design_A` directory (or a parent directory if it's part of a larger project structure). Create an initial commit. Push to a remote provider (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops` / `dev-git`
*   **5.2. Connect to Netlify:**
    *   Goal: Set up continuous deployment from the Git repository.
    *   Action: Create a new site on Netlify, connect it to the Git repository.
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops`
*   **5.3. Build Configuration (if needed):**
    *   Goal: Ensure Netlify can build/deploy the site.
    *   Action: For a static HTML/CSS/JS site, the publish directory will likely be the root of `output_design_A` or just `/`. No complex build command needed unless minification/optimization steps are added via a build tool.
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops`
*   **5.4. Custom Domain:**
    *   Goal: (If applicable) Configure a custom domain for the site.
    *   Action: Update DNS records as per Netlify instructions.
    *   Assigned: `lead-devops` / User
*   **5.5. Contact Form Handling:**
    *   Goal: Ensure the contact form submissions are captured.
    *   Action: Modify the `<form>` in `index.html` to use Netlify Forms (add `data-netlify="true"` attribute or `netlify` attribute).
    *   Assigned: `dev-core-web` / `lead-devops`

## 6. Testing & Go-Live

*   **6.1. Cross-Browser/Device Testing:**
    *   Goal: Ensure consistent appearance and functionality.
    *   Action: Test on major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   Assigned: `lead-qa` / `dev-core-web`
*   **6.2. Functionality Testing:**
    *   Goal: Verify all links, navigation, and the contact form work as expected on the Netlify deployment.
    *   Action: Thorough click-through and form submission test.
    *   Assigned: `lead-qa`
*   **6.3. Final Review & Go-Live:**
    *   Goal: Get final approval before wider announcement.
    *   Action: User review of the deployed site on Netlify.
    *   Assigned: User / `manager-product`
