# Task: Validate and Refine Landing Page Code (output_design_A)

## 1. Description

Perform code refinement and validation for the selected landing page located in the `output_design_A/` directory. This corresponds to **Step 1: Code Refinement & Validation** from the productionalization plan found in `.ruru/planning/productionize_landing_page_A_netlify.md`.

The primary files to focus on are:
*   [`output_design_A/index.html`](output_design_A/index.html)
*   [`output_design_A/style.css`](output_design_A/style.css)

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

*   `output_design_A/index.html` successfully passes W3C HTML validation with no errors.
*   `output_design_A/style.css` successfully passes W3C CSS validation with no errors.
*   `output_design_A/style.css` is linted (e.g., using Stylelint or adhering to common best practices if a specific linter isn't configured in the environment) and any reported issues are addressed.
*   Both `output_design_A/index.html` and `output_design_A/style.css` are consistently formatted (e.g., using Prettier or a similar code formatter).
*   Any unused CSS rules or significantly large blocks of commented-out HTML/CSS (remnants from development) are removed. Minor explanatory comments can remain.
*   All changes are applied directly to the files in the `output_design_A/` directory.

## 3. Checklist

*   [‚úÖ] **HTML Validation:** Validate [`output_design_A/index.html`](output_design_A/index.html) using an online W3C HTML validator (e.g., validator.w3.org). Document and fix any validation errors.
*   [‚úÖ] **CSS Validation:** Validate [`output_design_A/style.css`](output_design_A/style.css) using an online W3C CSS validator (e.g., jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/). Document and fix any validation errors.
*   [‚úÖ] **CSS Linting:** Lint [`output_design_A/style.css`](output_design_A/style.css). If Stylelint is available and configured, use it. Otherwise, perform a manual review for common CSS best practice violations (e.g., overly specific selectors, redundant properties, inefficient rules). Document and fix identified issues.
*   [‚úÖ] **Code Formatting:** Apply consistent code formatting to both [`output_design_A/index.html`](output_design_A/index.html) and [`output_design_A/style.css`](output_design_A/style.css) using a tool like Prettier (if available) or by manual adjustment to ensure readability and consistency.
*   [‚úÖ] **Code Cleanup:** Review both files for any unused CSS rules (e.g., using browser dev tools' coverage feature as a guide) or large blocks of commented-out code that are no longer needed. Remove them.
*   [‚úÖ] **Final Review:** Briefly review the changes to ensure no unintended side effects on the page's appearance or basic functionality.
*   [‚úÖ] **Confirmation:** Confirm all modifications have been saved directly to the files within the `output_design_A/` directory.
