# Active Context

## Current Work Focus

*   **Strategic Initiative Expansion:** Incorporating the new "Data Analytics Consultancy" service into Little Town Labs' offerings.
*   **Landing Page Development:** Iterating on landing page designs for Little Town Labs, specifically refining "Design 3" to better represent all three core services (HomeschoolingMinds, AeroCode, and Data Analytics Consultancy).
*   **Memory Bank Update:** Ensuring all core Memory Bank documents (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are updated to reflect the new consultancy service.

        *   `progress.md` updated to reflect the new consultancy, landing page development status, and project name change.

## Next Steps

*   Await user feedback on the finalized `output_design_A` ([`output_design_A/index.html`](output_design_A/index.html)).
*   Proceed with any further requested modifications to `output_design_A`.
*   If no further design changes, confirm completion of the landing page design phase and consider next steps for deployment or content integration.

## Active Decisions & Considerations

*   **Landing Page Finalized:** `output_design_A` is the chosen design. Path: [`output_design_A/index.html`](output_design_A/index.html).
*   **Landing Page Messaging:** How to best articulate the value proposition of all three distinct services (HomeschoolingMinds, AeroCode, Data Analytics Consultancy) on a single cohesive landing page without overwhelming the user (ongoing consideration for content population).
*   **Visual Differentiation:** How to visually distinguish or connect the three service offerings on the landing page while maintaining a unified brand identity for Little Town Labs (addressed in `output_design_A`).
*   **AeroCode Integration:** Clearly defining how AeroCode underpins both HomeschoolingMinds and the Data Analytics Consultancy (ongoing consideration for content).

## Important Patterns & Preferences

*   **User Preference:** User has selected `output_design_A` as the final landing page design.
*   **Memory Bank First:** Adherence to the "Memory Bank First" protocol, ensuring documentation is updated before or alongside development work.
*   **Iterative Design:** The current process involves iterative refinement of web designs based on feedback.

## Learnings & Project Insights

*   The initial "Design 3" provided a good starting point for a combined services landing page, but needs to more explicitly feature the new Data Analytics Consultancy.
*   Clearly defining the relationship and synergies between AeroCode and the other two service offerings (HomeschoolingMinds, Data Analytics Consultancy) is crucial for messaging.
